- If the live deploy fails, go to : netlify -> deploys -> trigger deploy -> clear cache and deploy site

- after publishing something from the gui you need to run "git pull" and "npm run serve" to get the changes. Same applies for both **localhost:3000/admin** and **domain/admin**

- after tweaking nuxt.config.js you need to restart your live server, or wait a bit longer

- go to netlify: settings -> build and deploy -> build command : npm run generate -> publish dir : dist/ 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build with server-side rendering for production
# and start server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project for production
$ npm run generate
```

See [starter template documentation in the README on GitHub](https://github.com/renestalder/nuxt-netlify-cms-starter-template) for additional usage and configuration.

## Edit content

``` bash
sudo npm install netlify-cli -g
metlify login
netlify plugins:install netlify-lm-plugin
netlify lm:setup
# the last command produces an output command which you should run
```

- To see your config run "cat .gitattributes"
- netlify cli stores your auth token localy here: "~/.netlify/config.json"
- to download the images handled by git lfs locally, remove them from /static/images/uploads/*, and then "git checkout ."
